	  <h2><u>Experiments Summary:</u></h2><br>
	  As a scientist at the Genesis Research Laboratory, I was shocked <br>
	  when rumors began circulating among my colleagues that our database of murders and <br>
	  experiments had been leaked. We all knew the sensitive and often controversial nature of <br>
	  our work, so the potential consequences of such a leak were alarming.<br>
	<br>
	The laboratory had long been involved in research into the human soul and its potential application<br>
	 in inanimate objects, and many of our experiments had resulted in unforeseen and dangerous consequences.<br>
	  But even with these risks, we believed our work was crucial to unlocking the mysteries of the human soul and its potential.<br>
	  <br>
However, the potential leak of our database had brought about a new sense of urgency and fear.<br>
 We knew that our research had its opponents, and the idea of our data falling into the wrong hands<br>
  could mean the end of the laboratory and possibly even criminal charges against us.<br>
  <br>
As we scrambled to investigate the potential source of the leak, a new threat emerged: the creature<br> 
known as Climb. This pitch-black hand with a single eye was created as an experiment, using the soul of<br>
 one of our laboratory tables. Climb was the most "alive" out of all the experiments. He always seem like he knew what was going on in his existance. But something had gone <br>
 terribly wrong, and the creature had become a dangerous and uncontrollable force.<br>
Climb began its rampage through the laboratory, attacking anyone and anything in its path. We were<br> 
unprepared and overwhelmed by its power, and many of us were injured or killed in its wake.<br>
<br>
As I write this, I am one of the few survivors of the attack. The laboratory is in ruins, and<br>
 the future of our research is uncertain. But even in the face of tragedy, I cannot help but wonder<br>
  if our own actions in experimenting with the human soul were ultimately responsible for the chaos and<br>
   destruction that followed.<br>
<br>
The potential leak of our database now seems almost trivial in comparison to the consequences of our experimentation.<br>
 As we attempt to pick up the pieces and move forward, we must also confront the ethical and moral implications of our work<br>
  and consider the true cost of unlocking the mysteries of the human soul.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2><u>Entry Final:</u></h2>
  As chaos and destruction engulfed the Genesis Research Laboratory, <br>
  the creatures created by the scientists fled in terror. From the strange<br>
   and twisted Chameleo, to the grotesque and powerful Fungex, each creature sought<br>
    refuge in the only place they knew was safe: the abandoned mansion of Halls. Once a <br>
	place of opulence and grandeur, the mansion had become a sanctuary for the very beings <br>
	that were once considered abominations. As they huddled together in the darkness, they could <br>
	only wonder what fate awaited them in the world outside as they remained as hostile as before.<br>
	Some of them actually came back to life a third time before and after escaping.<br>
